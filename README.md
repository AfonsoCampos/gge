[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/gge)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gge)

Functions for GGE (genotype plus genotype-by-environment) and GGB (genotype plus genotype-by-block-of-environments) biplots.

Key features:

* Stable, well-tested.

* Many options to control graphic appearance.

## Installation

```R
# Install the released version from CRAN:
install.packages("gge")

# Install the cutting edge development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kwstat/gge")
```
## Example

Here is an example GGB biplot.

![gge](figure/crossa_wheat.png?raw=true)

In the figure above, the genotypes are shown by green labels and the environments are shown by blue/gold labels. Each color determines a mega-environment or block-of-environments.  A thick, solid line is drawn from the origin to the 'average' of the environments within each block, and then a thinner line is drawn from the average to the individual environments.  These 'residual' vectors show the deviations within each group.  A dashed line extends to the edge of the plotting window and labels the group.
